IntelliJ IDEA Color Scheme
==========================

Here I publish my slightly modified color scheme for JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA. What I'm tried to achieve is to minimize syntax noise from Java language itself (curly braces adn other stuff) but put accent on semantic of fields and methods (are they static members, object members or local variables).

![Hope you like it :)](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/16254496/idea.png)

Installation
------------
Just download `settings.jar` file, then Run your IDE and import colorscheme settings from this file (`File` &rarr; `Import Settings...`)

Feedback appreciated.
